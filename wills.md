A Will, also known as a “Last Will and Testament,” is a legal document that outlines how your assets will be distributed after you pass away.

**What is a Will**?:

A Last Will and Testament allows you to do the following:

* Specify who will inherit your assets, including personal belongings, real property, and finances.

* Name an executor to manage your estate assets

* Appoint guardians for minor children.

 

**How Does a Will Work?**

In California, when a person passes away with a Will, their estate typically goes through a legal process through the court known as “probate.” This court process ensures that debts are paid, assets are distributed correctly, and legal formalities are met.

 

Because probate can be a lengthy and costly process, many individuals choose to create a Living Trust instead of relying solely on a Will. However, a Will is still a crucial estate planning tool for those who want to ensure their wishes are documented legally.


**Will or Trust…What is the difference**?

A “Will” only takes effect after you pass away, and must go through probate, which can be expensive and time-consuming, and is part of the public documents in a court. 

A “Living Trust” takes effect immediately upon signing and allows your assets to be distributed without court involvement, keeping the process private and efficient.

**Do I need a Will if I have a Living Trust**?

Answer is “Yes.” 

A Will only takes effect after you pass away and must go through probate, which can be expensive and time-consuming. A living trust, on the other hand, takes effect immediately and allows your assets to be distributed without court involvement, keeping the process private and efficient.
