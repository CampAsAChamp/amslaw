**Living Trust Information**

**What is a Trust:**

A Revocable Living Trust (“Living Trust”) is a legal arrangement allowing you to manage your assets during your lifetime and instructs how the assets are to be distributed after your passing. A living trust is one of the most effective estate planning tools to ensure that your assets are smoothly transferred to your heirs.

A living trust allows for a smooth transfer of assets without court involvement. Additionally, a living trust can help protect you and your estate in the event of incapacity, ensuring that your financial matters are managed according to your wishes.

**How does a Revocable Living Trust Work:**

1. While you are alive, you maintain full control over your Trust and property. You can add and / or remove property, change the beneficiaries, and change the Successor Trustees.
2. If you should become incapacitated, a Successor Trustee you’ve named will step in to manage your affairs.
3. Upon your passing, the Trust will become “irrevocable.” Your Successor Trustee will distribute your assets according to the provisions in your Trust. The Trust process will not go through the probate process.
