### Email Setup (Contact Form)

The contact form uses [Resend](https://resend.com) for email delivery and React Email components for beautiful, responsive email templates. Here's how to set it up:

#### 1. Sign Up for Resend

1. Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day, 3,000 emails/month)
3. Verify your email address

#### 2. Get Your API Key

1. Go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Name it something like "AMS Law Website"
4. Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables

**For Local Development:**

Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project:

```bash
# Resend API Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here

# Email address where contact form submissions will be sent
CONTACT_EMAIL=anna@schneiderlaw.com
```

**For Production (Cloudflare Workers):**

1. Update `CONTACT_EMAIL` in `wrangler.jsonc`:
```jsonc
"vars": {
  "CONTACT_EMAIL": "your-email@example.com"
}
```

2. Set `RESEND_API_KEY` as a secret using Wrangler CLI:
```bash
npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
```
When prompted, paste your Resend API key. This stores it securely in Cloudflare and persists across all deployments.

#### 4. Verify Your Domain (Optional but Recommended)

For the free tier, you can use Resend's default sending domain (`onboarding@resend.dev`), but emails will be more professional from your own domain.

To use your own domain:

1. Go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains) in Resend dashboard
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `schneiderlaw.com`)
4. Add the DNS records shown to your domain provider
5. Wait for verification (usually 5-10 minutes)
6. Update the API route to use your domain:

In `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`, change:
```typescript
from: 'AMS Law Contact Form <onboarding@resend.dev>',
```
to:
```typescript
from: 'AMS Law Contact Form <contact@yourdomain.com>',
```

#### 5. Test the Contact Form

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the Contact page
3. Fill out and submit the form
4. Check your email!

#### Troubleshooting

**"Failed to send email" error:**
- Check that your `.env.local` file exists and has the correct API key
- Restart your dev server after creating/updating `.env.local`
- Verify your API key is active in the Resend dashboard

**Not receiving emails:**
- Check your spam folder
- Verify the `CONTACT_EMAIL` is correct (in `.env.local` for local, `wrangler.jsonc` for production)
- Check the Resend dashboard [Emails](https://resend.com/emails) to see if they're being sent
- For production, verify you've set the `RESEND_API_KEY` secret using `npx wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY`

**Environment Variables:**
- ✅ Local: Use `.env.local` (never commit this file)
- ✅ Production: Set `CONTACT_EMAIL` in `wrangler.jsonc` and `RESEND_API_KEY` via Wrangler CLI
- Make sure you've verified your domain for better deliverability

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit your `.env.local` file to git
- The API key is server-side only (Next.js API route)
- Users cannot see or access your API key from the browser

## Deployment

### Automatic Deployment

The site is deployed to Cloudflare Workers with automatic build and deployment configured through Cloudflare's Git integration. Every push to the `main` branch automatically:

- Builds the Next.js application
- Generates the Cloudflare Workers bundle using OpenNext
- Deploys to production at [annamschneiderlaw.com](https://annamschneiderlaw.com)

### Manual Deployment

You can also deploy manually using the following commands:

| Command                 | Action                                      |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `npm run build`         | Build your Next.js production site          |
| `npm run preview`       | Preview OpenNext build locally              |
| `npm run deploy`        | Build and deploy to Cloudflare Workers      |
| `npm run lint`          | Run ESLint to check code quality            |
| `npm run check`         | Build and run TypeScript type checking      |

### Environment Variables in Production

Environment variables are configured in `wrangler.jsonc`:

- **Non-sensitive variables** (like `CONTACT_EMAIL`): Set in the `vars` section of `wrangler.jsonc`
- **Secrets** (like `RESEND_API_KEY`): Set using `npx wrangler secret put VARIABLE_NAME`

Secrets set via Wrangler CLI are encrypted and stored securely in Cloudflare, persisting across all deployments.

## Design System

This project uses a custom design system with CSS variables defined in `src/app/globals.css`:

- **Color Variables** - Consistent color palette using CSS custom properties
- **Utility Classes** - Pre-defined button styles, text colors, and backgrounds
- **Responsive Breakpoints** - Tailwind CSS breakpoints for responsive design

### Key Guidelines

- Always use CSS variables and utility classes for colors (never hardcode colors)
- Use absolute imports with `@/` alias for all local files
- Follow TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility

See `.cursorrules` for complete coding standards and conventions.

### Reference Documentation

The `reference/docs/` directory contains detailed markdown documentation about legal services:

- `living_trust.md` - Information about living trusts
- `wills.md` - Information about wills and estate planning

These documents serve as content reference for the website and can be used for FAQ content or service descriptions.
